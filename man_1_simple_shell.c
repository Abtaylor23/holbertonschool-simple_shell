Shell Program in C
Introduction
This C program represents a basic shell that continuously prompts the user for input, reads the input, and executes the corresponding command. It is composed of three primary functions: display_prompt, user_input, and execute_command. The program utilizes a simple loop to maintain an interactive shell environment.

Code Breakdown
Main Function
The main function serves as the entry point of the program. It initializes a character array command of size 128 to store user input. Inside an infinite loop, it performs the following steps:

Display Prompt: Calls the display_prompt function to show a prompt to the user.

c
Copy code
display_promt();
User Input: Calls the user_input function to read the user's input into the command array.

c
Copy code
user_input(command, sizeof(command));
Execute Command: Calls the execute_command function to execute the command provided by the user.

c
Copy code
execute_command(command);
display_prompt Function
This function is expected to display a prompt to the user, indicating that the shell is ready to receive input. The implementation of this function is assumed to be in the "shell.h" file.

user_input Function
The user_input function reads a line of text from the standard input (stdin) and stores it in the provided command array. It handles potential errors during input and removes the trailing newline character.

execute_command Function
The execute_command function creates a child process using fork and attempts to execute the specified command in the child process using execlp. The parent process waits for the child process to complete its execution.

Conclusion
In summary, this program represents a basic shell that allows users to enter commands, executes them, and displays the results. The simplicity of the code allows for easy understanding and serves as a foundation for more advanced shell implementations. The actual implementation details for functions like display_prompt are assumed to be provided in the "shell.h" file.
