# NAME
    shell - Interactive shell program

# SYNOPSIS
    #include "shell.h"
    #include "input.h"

    int main(void);

# DESCRIPTION
    The `shell` program serves as a simple interactive shell, providing users
    with a command-line interface to interact with the system. Upon execution,
    it initializes the shell environment and enters an infinite loop. Within
    this loop, the program continuously prompts the user for input, reads the
    input, and executes corresponding commands.

# RETURN VALUE
    The `main` function returns 0 upon successful execution.

# EXAMPLES
    To compile and run the shell program, use the following commands:

    ```sh
    gcc shell.c input.c -o shell
    ./shell
    ```

    Once the shell is running, you can enter commands and observe their execution.
